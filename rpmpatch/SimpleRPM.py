'''
   The idea here was to make it really easy to do some basic stuff
   with an RPM in a much cleaner mode than the default 'rpm' object
   will allow.  The RPM object is able to install and remove packages
   which requires it to have way more functionality than I need for
   simply looking at a package.  This object has its goal in being
   far more simple.

   So it doesn't do a whole lot.... but what it does it does cleanly

class SimpleRPM(object):
    '''
       This is just a simple class that abstracts away
       some of the more frustrating things to get out of
       an RPM.  Not that it is hard, it is just ugly.

       If anything goes wrong this class throws an
       IOError.

       I've overloaded:

             != == >= <= < > and 'in'

             for > and <   it compares version info if
                            the package name is the same

             for == and !=  it compares bit for bit

             <= and >=  exist and work as a union of the above
                         but that is a bit weird so....

             You can even pass in a filename rather than a SimpleRPM object
              if you want, it will then create the necessary object for
              shorterm use so your code can be even more simple.

             NOTE: the RPM name MUST MATCH or you will get problems
                   so check that before you try to compare, you've been warned

             the 'in' construct checks files within the rpm
