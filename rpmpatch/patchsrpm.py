Things are run in groups organized by their section names.
Each section is run alphabeticaly, but the sections are run in this order:

autodist -> spec-> re -> patch -> source

This way your specfile adjustments and regex matches don't need to contend
with your other modifications

Example Config:

# you can override this on the command line

# to configure this program will be added to the
# source rpm

# that were not applied due to version restrictions
# will be placed in a tar archive called
# %{name}-extras-python-rpmpatch.tar.bz2

# if set to 'True' then rpmbuild -bb will be called
# automatically rather than just rpmbuild -bs

# if this is defined, when a compile is requested
# the items here will be passed to rpmbuild as 
# a --target=<>

[autodist]
# This program can attempt to determine the
# dist tag of the package and set it automatically
#
# NOTE: if you've defined 'dist' in the [define]
#       section, this will not work.
#       Everything defined in [define] will be used
#       to determine the dist tag.
enable_autodist = False

# Since you are changing the rpm, you really
# should change the dist tag, but with autodist
# the value is inherited from the source rpm
# so we provide a regex to wrapper to adjust

# ----------------------------------------------------

# this is how you can do it.
# They are processed in numeric order
[spec1]
